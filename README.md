# Chat Room
Chat room app. Will allow users to join your server if they know your ip address and will allow users to chat with each other. 

Although I built this project independently, I followed the same protocol that our team had planned together beforehand. During this time I improved my understanding of computer networks as I had to understand how to implement a chatroom based on our protocol. Despite working on the code individually, effective communication with the team was essential to ensure that the protocol was useful and could be implemented in our individual projects. All in all this project made me understand the importance of debugging and comments in code. It also made me more aware of the importance of good collaboration as we were a team of seven people who planned the protocol together.
